# hello guys this is program used to find remainders of a number
# a = input("hello sir please enter the numbers")
# print("the remainder of the number when divided by 2 is ",int(a)%2)
# # remember that the inputs need to be converted into int format before using them in the above code line
# hello guys this is one of the things used to inspect the things
# a  = input("sir please enter the value : ")
# print(type(a))
# b = input("sir please enter the number you want to square")
# b = int(b)
# print("sir the square of the number you have given is ",b*b)
# the sequence of characters enclosed in quotes is a string
# string is primarily a data type used in python
# we can use write string in three types
a = "rajesh"
b = 'rajesh'
c = '''rajesh'''
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
# so a question arises why we have three types of enclosings when the value of the output is same in all print values
# it's because
a = 'rajesh"man'
b = "hello's"
c = '''hello
            hello'"'''
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
# the values entered in the three quoted quotes is literally printed the same and the values you give in it are same for everythin you need to look at it
# lust is the biggest poison
b = "mahaveer"
print(b[0])
print(b[0:3])
