# while i == True:

# j = 1
# while j<=10:
#     print("hello sir your number is",j)
#     j = j+1
# such loops have many implications you better learn it greatly
# b = ["mango","watermelon","peepal","orange"]
# i = 0
# while i<len(b):
#     print(b[i])

# printing the above items using for loops 
# for item in b:
#     print(item)

# convert mistakes into wisdom
# for item in range(1,8):
#     print(item)

# range(start,stop,step_size)
# for item in range(1,7,3):
#     print(item)

# you can use for loops for many uses
# for item in range(10):

# here else statement is only executed when the for loop is succesfully executed else it will not get executed it is very importanat to know about executing things

# this is a continue statement

# for item in range(10):
#     if item==5:
#         continue
#     print(item)

# this is a pass statement

# for item in range(10):
