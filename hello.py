# hello guys in this tutorial we are going to learn about data types and type casting
# have you ever heard of conversion of water to ice and to vapour
# similar thing is done with type casting
# a = "shiva" # here shiva is a string as it is composed of letters and the thing which is covered by these parenthesis is a string
# print(a)
# similarly "22" is a string
# assume string to be water see to covert water to ice what we generally do ?
# we cool it right.
# similarly to convert string to integer we use int function we just put "22"(water) in the int(here)(fridge)
# this converts "22" to 22
# you can imagine that it just removes the parenthesis and 22 is itself an integer
# so int function generally gives integer as a output in most cases.what most cases ?
# yes in most case suppose take "shiva" if you put shiva in int() let's think integer removes "" but shiva is composed of letters so it
# gives a string as an output then remember that the string laws are superior and given more priority
# what happens when you put a steel rod in vessel and heat it 
# # it state doesn't change right?
# # similarly if you put a value composed of letter in int()(vessel) nothing changes and it gives you an error
# # float() functions also works in this way float is similar to int it has all properties of int but it can perform actions with int
# # values let int values be water then if you put it in container named float() and heat it what happens the water changes to vapour 
# # right similarly if you put integer values such as 1,2,0,-1,-2 into float it converts it into decimal values such as 1.0,2.0.0
# # so function of float is that it converts the values into decimal system's
# a = input("sir please enter the value we wil show the type of thing it is")
# # print(type(a))
# # print(a)
# # print(type(int(a)))
# # a = int(a)
# # print(a)
# # print(type(float(a)))
# print(float(a))
# print(a)
# let 
# python is one of the wonderful languages which can be used to build programs and many things using python you can also build responsive websites
