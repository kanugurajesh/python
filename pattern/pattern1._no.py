# for i in range(1,6):
#     for j in range(1,10):
#         print("*",end="")
#     print()

# see the code can be runned in many way and it is one of the things you can do
# for i in range(6):
#     print("*")

# now let's do another pattern printing program

# for i in range(1,6):
#     for j in range(1,6):
#         print(i,end=" ")
#     print()

# the above one is also a kind of program

# for i in range(1,6):
#     for j in range(1,6):
#         print(j,end="")
#     print()

# hello guys let's go with the program

for i in range(65,70):
    for j in range(1,6):
        print(chr(i),end="")
    print()

for i in range(1,6):
    for j in range(65,70):
        print(chr(j),end="")
    print()
